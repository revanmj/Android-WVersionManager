[![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/revanmj/Android-WVersionManager/com.winsontan520.wversionmanager/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/revanmj/Android-WVersionManager/com.winsontan520.wversionmanager/_latestVersion)

## Objective
Things changed/added by this fork:
- Convert WVersionManager library to an Android Studio project and remove depency on deprecated org.apache.http library (replacing all calls with URLConnection or HttpURLConnection)
- Add option to download update using Android's Download Manager. Remember that your app must have "android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" permission for this to work:
`versionManager.useDownloadManager(true);`
- Add option to automatically open downloaded APK file, as long as app has proper permissions in Oreo (android.permission.REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES) or Unknown sources is enabled in case of lower versions. Otherwise Downloads app will be launched):
`versionManager.installAfterDownload(true);`
- Add option to force update check (by ignoring remind timer): `versionManager.checkVersion(true);`
- Instead of setting strings (like button labels) by code, let them be overridden by adding them to app's strings.xml file (list of all string ids from this library can be [seen here](https://github.com/revanmj/Android-WVersionManager/blob/master/library/wversionmanager/src/main/res/values/strings.xml))
- Implemented concept of a "blocking update" - after adding `is_blocking` field set to true in your JSON file, default update dialog will only show **Update** button (it also won't be cancelable). You also will be able to check this value by calling `versionManager.isBlockingUpdate();` after update check or using `onReceive(int status, boolean isBlocking, String result)` method from `com.winsontan520.wversionmanager.OnReceiveListener`. This will be also saved to SharedPreferences, so it will survive app restart.

Compiled .jar file can be downloaded from [releases tab](https://github.com/revanmj/Android-WVersionManager/releases) or added in build.gradle from jcenter repo:
```
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.winsontan520.wversionmanager:wversionmanager:1.7'
}
```
